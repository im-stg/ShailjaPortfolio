                      I worked with Shailja for 10 months during her internship project at Keysight Tech, Manesar. She is well versed with fundamentals of programming along with problem solving. She is fast learner to adapt new technologies and delivering results at the same time.

                      During her internship project, she proved to be an energetic team player. She worked very well on all aspects of project like backend server, managing database along with designing good looking and well presented front-end GUIs.</p>
                      
                    <p>  I am sure she will excel in her future assignments irrespective of technology or domains.
